# Adaptive Multi-Feature Fusion for Visible-Infrared Image Registration and Character Enhancement of Bamboo Slips

## 📖 Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of the paper "Adaptive Multi-Feature Fusion for Visible-Infrared Image Registration and Character Enhancement of Bamboo Slips".This study proposes an infrared-visible image registration method specifically designed for bamboo slip images.

## 🎯 Research Objectives

- Develop an infrared-visible image registration algorithm
- Achieve accurate registration of infrared and visible light images
- Reveal faded or blurred ink traces in visible images of bamboo slips
- Provide technical support for digital research and preservation of bamboo slips

## 🔬 Key Contributions

- A coarse registration module for multimodal bamboo slip images is proposed, utilizing the relatively stable characteristics of edge information across different modalities and under downsampling conditions to achieve global registration between multimodal bamboo slip images.

- A module for fine registration of globally registered multimodal bamboo slip images is proposed. Through innovation of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm by replacing the original single reliance on raw points with edge-corner features, while innovatively modifying the weights of different features dynamically during algorithm iterations, the challenges posed by weak texture in bamboo slip image registration are addressed.

- A registration optimization module based on a hybrid optimization strategy combining gradient optimization with multi-restart simulated annealing is proposed, fine-tuning registration results through mutual information maximization.
